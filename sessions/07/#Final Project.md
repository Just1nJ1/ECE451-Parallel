#Final Project

1. Testing
  * prove your project works
  * Example: sorting
  * write a function to generate a known distribution
    * 1, 2, 3, ... n
    * shuffle the n numbers
    * count and make sure you still have 1,2,3, ... n
    * 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, ...n
  * Compare to known library
  * Example: matrices = LAPACK, BLAS
  * Your library does not have to perform as well as a commercial one
* You do not have to do a final paper
  * You might want a final handout?
* Still deciding
  * Do we make you do research?
