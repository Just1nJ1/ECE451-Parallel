# Midterm Concepts

1. Multithreading
2. Limitations of memory
   1. sequential
   2. cache
      1. Level 1: small (128k D-cache, 128k i-cache)
      2. Level 2: bigger 2MBytes
      3. Level 3: 32MB
   3. read/write
   4. burst mode: 1 slow, 7 fast
   5. dual banks: 2 banks = 16
   6. rows and cols (memory is a square)
   7. Memory manager is NOT ON MIDTERM 
3. Pipelining
4. Optimizer
   1. "unnecessary" code gets optimized out, can fool you!
5.
