Eratosthenes' sieve is very intensive on memory

if n is large we need n/30*8 bits of memory
n/30 bytes

even before you run out, you are blowing cache

segmented means identifying the size of cache (256k)

do everything to memory that fits into cache, then move on

n=10^9
instead of: [0.. n]

[0.. sqrt(n)] = 33000]

[33k..33k + 256k] [+1 .. +512k]
