#Potential Algorothms for CUDA and ISCD/OpenMP

1. Mandelbrot
   Mandelbulber
2. Merge Sort (complicated), Merge sort is parallel for each Merge
   but merging two lists into one is SEQUENTIAL therefore NOT GOOD for CUDA
3. matrix
   * multiplication
   * Gram-Schmidt
   * Solving systems of linear equations
   * Calculate Spline for n points
4. Graph theory high speed CSR implementation
5. FFT
6.
