# Midterm Summary

1. Explain how memory attributes affect a computation
  * sequential
  * multiple banks
  * skipping large amounts
  * cache level 1, 2, 3

2. Explain how threading impacts performance
  * threading scales well or poorly depending on limiting factors (memory)
  * explain why increasing hte number of threads without bounds does not help
  * hyperthreading

3. Vectorization
   1. When can vectorization help?


4. Modern CPU features affecting computation
   1. Pipelining (if statements)
   2. Cache misses


All questions may involve code I give you to analyze (C++)

or

You write sample code that would/would not be parallel/vector
