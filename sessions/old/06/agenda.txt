Looking for problem spaces
	Clean, SIMPLE mesh problem
	Finite Element analysis: heat? stress/strain (harder)
	tides (2d gravity)
	ocean currents (3d, horribly complex)
	atmospheric simulation (3d, even worse)
	*Mandelbrot
	*Gravity Simulator

	F = Gm_1m_2/(r^2)
	a1 = Gm_2/r^2

	faster algorithm: big bodies affect small bodies (Jupiter affects asteroids) but space ship does not affect big bodies
