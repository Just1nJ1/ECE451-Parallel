#Intel Hyperthreading

n = 4 cores
each core has several execution units
     *add
     *multiply 3-4 clock cycles
     load/save
     decode instruction
     *vector avx unit 1
     vector avx unit 2

WHat could stall a CPU?
     wait for memory
     wait for instruction to load

WHat does a thread need
PC = rip = where the code is
SP = stack
registers

Hyperthreading adds two sets of registers to every CPU
rip	       	    	     		  rip
rsp					  rsp
RAX	       	    	     		  RAX
RBX					  RBX

FAST FAST FAST switching between two threads
whichever units of thread 1 are not used can be used by thread2???
